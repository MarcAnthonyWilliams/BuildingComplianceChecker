# Building Compliance Checker 
## Overview

The **Building Compliance Checker project** is a demonstration of both frontend and backend engineering skills. This application simulates the process of validating building elements for compliance with pre-defined rules, similar to functionality that might be used in architectural or engineering software like Revit.

Through this project, I aim to:

- Showcase my ability to create and consume a REST API using Express.js.
- Demonstrate dynamic frontend functionality using React.
- Apply my knowledge of state management and API integration in a practical application.

## Features
1. Backend (Express.js):

- A RESTful API that accepts building element submissions.
- Validates elements based on mock compliance rules.
- Returns detailed validation results for each element.
2. Frontend (React):

- A React-based dashboard that:
- Allows users to "submit" building elements.
- Displays a list of submitted elements along with their validation status.
- Dynamically fetches and renders data from the backend.
3. Validation Rules:

### Example rules used in the application:
-  Stairs: Must have a height between 34â€“38 inches.
-  Doors: Must be at least 32 inches wide.
-  These rules mimic real-world building code constraints.
## Project Architechture
This project is divided into two main components:
1. Frontend (React + Vite):
   - Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the API.
   - Displays building elemnet validation results dynamically.
2. Backend (Express.js):
   - Servers as the API to handle building element submissions.
   - Performs validation logic and returns results to the frontend
